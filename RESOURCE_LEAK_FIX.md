# üîß Resource Leak Fix - Unclosed aiohttp Session

## The Problem
```
Unclosed client session
Unclosed connector
```

These warnings indicate that the bot's aiohttp client session wasn't being properly closed when the application shuts down, causing resource leaks.

## The Solution

### 1. Added Proper Shutdown Handler
Added `@app.on_event("shutdown")` to properly close the bot's aiohttp session:

```python
@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def on_shutdown():
    """Cleanup resources on shutdown"""
    try:
        # Close the bot session
        await bot.close_session()
        logger.info("Bot session closed successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during shutdown: {e}")
```

### 2. Fixed Root Endpoint
The root endpoint (`/`) was calling `delete_webhook()` and `set_webhook()` on every request, which:
- Created unnecessary aiohttp connections
- Caused resource leaks
- Disrupted the webhook

**Before:**
```python
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    await bot.delete_webhook()  # ‚ùå BAD
    await bot.set_webhook(url=f"{config.WEBHOOK_URL}{config.WEBHOOK_PATH}")  # ‚ùå BAD
    await bot.get_webhook_info()  # ‚ùå BAD
    return {"status": "running", ...}
```

**After:**
```python
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    """Root endpoint - simple status check"""
    return {"status": "running", ...}  # ‚úÖ GOOD
```

## What Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `main.py` | Added `@app.on_event("shutdown")` handler |
| `main.py` | Removed webhook calls from root endpoint |

---

## Impact

‚úÖ No more "Unclosed client session" warnings  
‚úÖ Proper resource cleanup on shutdown  
‚úÖ No unnecessary webhook operations  
‚úÖ Better performance (no webhook reset on every root request)  
‚úÖ Cleaner logs  

---

## Deploy Instructions

1. **Upload the updated `main.py`** to your server
2. **Restart the application:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/repositories/Registeration-Bot
   touch tmp/restart.txt
   ```

3. **Verify no warnings:**
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/logs/passenger.log
   ```

You should no longer see the "Unclosed client session" warnings!

---

## Additional Notes

- The webhook is set once during startup (in `on_startup()`)
- The webhook is NOT removed on shutdown anymore (this is intentional - it should remain set)
- The bot session is properly closed on shutdown
- Root endpoint now returns status instantly without any async operations

## All Issues Fixed So Far

1. ‚úÖ WSGIMiddleware TypeError ‚Üí ASGIMiddleware
2. ‚úÖ psycopg2 not found ‚Üí psycopg3 auto-conversion
3. ‚úÖ aiohttp build error ‚Üí Updated version
4. ‚úÖ Startup event not registering ‚Üí Added decorator
5. ‚úÖ **Unclosed aiohttp session ‚Üí Added shutdown handler**
6. ‚úÖ **Unnecessary webhook calls ‚Üí Cleaned root endpoint**

Your bot should now run cleanly without any warnings! üéâ
