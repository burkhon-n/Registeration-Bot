# 🔧 Critical Fix Applied - Upload These Files!

## The Problem
```
TypeError: WSGIMiddleware.__call__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'send'
```

## The Solution
FastAPI is an **ASGI** application, but `passenger_wsgi.py` was using **WSGIMiddleware** (wrong!).

Changed from:
```python
application = WSGIMiddleware(app)  # ❌ WRONG
```

To:
```python
application = ASGIMiddleware(app)  # ✅ CORRECT
```

## 📤 Files to Upload (UPDATED)

**Priority 1 - Upload these FIRST:**
1. ✅ `passenger_wsgi.py` - **CRITICAL FIX!**
2. ✅ `database.py` - Fixed psycopg3 compatibility
3. ✅ `main.py` - Fixed startup event registration

**Priority 2 - Also upload:**
4. ✅ `requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies
5. ✅ `config.py` - Documentation updates
6. ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Reference guide

---

## 🚀 Deploy Steps

### 1. Upload Files
Upload all the files listed above to: `/home/bagriken/repositories/Registeration-Bot/`

### 2. Restart Application
```bash
cd ~/repositories/Registeration-Bot
mkdir -p tmp
touch tmp/restart.txt
```

Or from cPanel: **Python App → Restart**

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After uploading and restarting:
- ✅ No more "WSGIMiddleware.__call__() missing argument" error
- ✅ No more "No module named 'psycopg2'" error
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ Bot responds to Telegram messages

---

## 🧪 Test After Deployment

```bash
# Test the root endpoint
curl https://yourdomain.com

# Should return:
# {"status":"running","message":"Registration Bot Webhook Server","webhook_path":"/webhook/..."}

# Test health check
curl https://yourdomain.com/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy"}
```
